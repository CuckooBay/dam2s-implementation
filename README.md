# Implementation of DAM2S 
This is a group project for HKU COMP7404 Computational Intelligence. We are group 29. In this project, we are implementing a visual recognition techniques for RGB pictures taking advantages of RGB-D training data proposed in the paper [Visual Recognition in RGB Images and Videos by Learning from RGB-D Data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8000401)
